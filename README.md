# User Input Code-Along

In this code-along you will create a simple web page with a single user story:

* As a user I can enter some text and select a substring of that text to be shown in the main display.

Your site will respond to a user-generated event, read & processing user inputs from the DOM, and displaying the result back to the DOM.
